## Tech used:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

### Observations:
This is one of my firts projects and it's the first where i used JavaScript.
Over time I made some changes, namely, upgraded the code so that after a calculation, the screen would reset to start another.

#### Things I Learned:
when I firts made the app:
  Learned the onclick() event;
  Learned to create functions and handle user input;
  Learned the eval() funtion.
When I upgraded the app:
  Practiced querySelector;
  Practiced if...else statements;
  Practiced boolean and logical operator.
